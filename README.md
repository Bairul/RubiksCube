# RubiksCube
I started working on this project during the height of the pandemic in 2020. I learned Java graphics and game making from youtube. 
The code right now is very sloppy and hard to read, but I will try to clean it up in my spare time. 

This project is able to scramble and solve itself using the Roux method.
